# Biblio

### Project Description
Biblio will give users a no-nonsense way to research authors free of distractions. The problem with current means of researching authors is the pressure to buy other, many times un-related, products. This tool will use Google Maps to place an author in their real-life element and humanize their story with a short bio and a quick reference to their most popular works.

### MVP
1. google map
2. form: search field to search by book author
	* or search by book title
	* clear button to reset field and map
3. render results
	* map zooms to author’s birthplace
		* if not known, zooms to last place lived
	* map shows author’s face as avatar // clickable balloon on map
4. user clicks author’s face
	* card opens with baseline author data:
		* full name
		* birth info
		* death info (if applicable)
		* short bio
		* 3 most popular works
