# GT: Group 07 Project

## Biblio

### Project Description
Biblio will give users a no-nonsense way to research authors free of distractions. The problem with current means of researching authors is the pressure to buy other, many times un-related, products. This tool will use Google Maps to place an author in their real-life element and humanize their story with a short bio and a quick reference to their most popular works.

### Team Roles
